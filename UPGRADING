Intro
~~~~~

This document describes how to upgrade our platform from one version to
another. It shows specific details that are out of the tarball/git
update workflow.

v0.1 -> v0.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * You have to manually add two new columns in the videos_video
   table. Just like this::

     $ python manage.py dbshell
     >>> ALTER TABLE videos_video ADD COLUMN "creation_date" datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT now();
     >>> ALTER TABLE videos_video ADD COLUMN "event_date" datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT now();

   The example above is based on the mysql backend. If you're using
   sqlite for example, you'll need to create the column with some fake
   data and then update it with the value returned by `datetime()', just
   like this::

     >>> ALTER TABLE videos_video ADD COLUMN "creation_date" datetime NOT NULL;
     >>> UPDATE videos_video SET creation_date = datetime();
